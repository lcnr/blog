# Fixing Boolfuck

The first finished project I have ever written in [Rust] is an interpreter for [boolfuck], an esoteric programming language created by Samuel Hughes. 
I revisited it one and a half years later and decided to fix most mistakes that I have made.

A [boolfuck] program uses only 7 different functions: `+`, `>`, `<`, `[`, `]`, `,
